# Shell

![width:600px](../media/42806128185_fcb7e34927_c.jpg)

---

## What is the Shell?

> A command-line interpreter that allows users to access an operating system's services

Example - list directory contents:
```shell
$ ls
```

**Key Concept**: Intermediary between user and OS kernel

**Control path**: user â†’ terminal â†’ shell â†’ kernel â†’ hardware

---

## Common Shells by OS

| OS      | Default Shell  |
| ------- | -------------- |
| Linux   | **bash**       |
| macOS   | **zsh**        |
| Windows | **PowerShell** |

### Important Terminology
- **Terminal**: the program that provides the window/interface
- **Shell**: the program that interprets and executes commands
- **Command Prompt**: the text indicator showing the shell is ready for input

---

## Why Learn Shell Commands?

1. **Automation**: Repetitive tasks can be scripted
2. **Efficiency**: Often faster than GUI for many tasks
3. **Remote Access**: Essential for managing servers
4. **Power**: Access to system features not available in GUI
5. **Universal**: Works on minimal systems without graphical interface

---

## File System Hierarchy

```
/                       # root directory
/dir1/                  # 1st level directory
/dir1/dir2/             # 2nd level directory
/dir1/dir2/file1.md     # File
```

<div class='cols'><div>

### Path Types
- **Absolute**: starts from root e.g. `/home/user/documents`
- **Relative**: starts from current dir e.g. `./documents`

</div><div>

### Special Paths
- `~` : user home dir
- `.` : current dir
- `..` : parent dir
- `-` : previous dir

</div></div>

---

## Basic Navigation Commands

| Command | Purpose                 | Example         |
| ------- | ----------------------- | --------------- |
| `pwd`   | print working directory | `pwd`           |
| `ls`    | list dir contents       | `ls -al`        |
| `cd`    | change dir              | `cd /home/user` |

### Common `ls` Options
```shell
ls -l    # Long format with details
ls -a    # Show hidden files (starting with .)
ls -h    # Human-readable file sizes
ls -t    # Sort by modification time
ls -r    # Reverse sort
ls -R    # Recursive listing
```

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Active Learning: Navigation Practice

**Try these commands (think about what each does):**

1. `pwd`
2. `ls -la`
3. `cd ..`
4. `cd ~`
5. `ls -lht`

---

## File/Directory Manipulation

### Creating and Deleting

| Command | Purpose                               | Example                |
| ------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `mkdir` | make dir                              | `mkdir -p path/to/dir` |
| `touch` | create empty file or update timestamp | `touch file.txt`       |
| `rm`    | remove files/directories              | `rm -rf dir1/`         |
| `rmdir` | remove empty dir                      | `rmdir dir2`           |

---

## Copying and Moving

```shell
cp source.txt dest.txt           # Copy source to dest
cp -r source_dir/ dest_dir/      # Copy directory recursively
mv oldname.txt newname.txt       # Rename/move file
mv file.txt /new/location/       # Move to different directory
```

---

## Pattern Matching with Wildcards

```shell
*        # Matches zero or more characters
?        # Matches exactly one character
[abc]    # Matches any one of a, b, or c
[0-9]    # Matches any digit
[^abc]   # Matches any character except a, b, or c
```

### Examples:
```shell
ls *.txt           # All .txt files
rm file?.pdf       # Remove file1.pdf, file2.pdf, etc.
cp [A-Z]*.doc ~/   # Copy all .doc files starting with uppercase
```

**Globbing**: process by which shell expands wildcards into a list of matching pathnames

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Active Learning: Wildcards Challenge

**What files would these commands match?**

1. `ls data_*.csv`
2. `rm test[1-3].txt`
3. `cp *.py backup/`
4. `ls [^0-9]*`

---

## Viewing File Contents

| Command | Purpose                                            | Example               |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `cat`   | Concatenate and display (small files)              | `cat file.txt`        |
| `less`  | Page through large files                           | `less large_file.log` |
| `head`  | Show first lines for a quick preview               | `head -n 20 file.txt` |
| `tail`  | Show last lines e.g. to see the latest log entries | `tail -f logfile.txt` |

**Tip**: `tail -f` is great for monitoring log files in real-time!

---

## Text Processing Commands

| Command | Purpose                         | Example                      |
| ------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `grep`  | Search text patterns            | `grep "error" logfile.txt`   |
| `sed`   | Stream editor                   | `sed 's/old/new/g' file.txt` |
| `awk`   | Pattern scanning and processing | `awk '{print $1}' data.txt`  |
| `sort`  | Sort lines                      | `sort -n numbers.txt`        |
| `uniq`  | Report or filter unique lines   | `uniq -c file.txt`           |
| `cut`   | Extract columns                 | `cut -d',' -f2 data.csv`     |
| `wc`    | Word, line, character count     | `wc -l file.txt`             |

---

## Grep and Regular Expressions

**Connection**: DFA/NFA/Regular-Expression equivalently specify a Regular Language

```shell
# Search for "error" in file
grep "error" logfile.txt

# Case-insensitive search
grep -i "error" logfile.txt

# Recursive search
grep -r "function" ./src/

# Show line numbers
grep -n "warning" logfile.txt

# Count matches
grep -c "failed" logfile.txt
```

---

<div class='cols'><div>

## Grep Essential Options

```shell
grep -i    # Case-insensitive
grep -v    # Invert match
grep -n    # Line numbers
grep -c    # Count matches
grep -r    # Recursive
grep -E    # Extended regex
grep -w    # Word match
grep -A/-B/-C # Context lines
```

</div><div>

### Basic Regex Patterns
```
.          # Any character
*          # Zero or more of preceding
^          # Start of line
$          # End of line
[abc]      # Character class
[^abc]     # Negated class
\          # Escape special character
```

</div></div>

---

## Grep Common Examples

**Email Addresses:**
```shell
grep -E "[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}" emails.txt
```

**IP Addresses:**
```shell
grep -E "[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}" file.txt
```

**Phone Numbers:**
```shell
grep -E "([0-9]{3})-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}" file.txt  # 555-123-4567
```

**URLs:**
```shell
grep -E "https?://[[:alnum:].-]+" file.txt
```

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Active Learning: Grep Challenge

Given a file `logs.txt` with various error messages:

**Write grep commands to:**
1. Find all lines containing "ERROR" (case-insensitive)
2. Find lines that start with a date format MM/DD/YYYY
3. Count how many times "timeout" appears
4. Find all email addresses in the file

---

## Redirection and Pipes

### Standard Streams
- **stdin (0)**: standard input
- **stdout (1)**: standard output
- **stderr (2)**: standard error

### Redirection Operators
```shell
>   # Redirect stdout (overwrite)
>>  # Redirect stdout (append)
<   # Redirect stdin
2>  # Redirect stderr
&>  # Redirect both stdout and stderr
```

---

## Redirection Examples

```shell
# Save ls output to file
ls > file_list.txt

# Append to file
echo "text" >> log.txt

# Input from file, output to file
sort < unsorted.txt > sorted.txt

# Redirect only errors
command 2> errors.log

# Redirect everything
command &> all_output.log
```

---

## Pipes: Combining Commands

**Pipe (`|`)**: Send output of one command as input to another

```shell
# List only .txt files
ls -l | grep ".txt"

# Sort and remove duplicates
cat file.txt | sort | uniq

# Find Python processes
ps aux | grep python

# Show last 20 commands
history | tail -20

# Check specific disk usage
df -h | grep /dev/sda
```

---

## Command Substitution

```shell
# Modern syntax
echo "Today is $(date)"

# Backtick syntax (older)
echo "Files: `ls | wc -l`"
```

**Best Practice**: Use `$(command)` syntax - it's more readable and nestable

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Active Learning: Pipes Practice

**What will these commands do?**

1. `ls -l | wc -l`
2. `cat names.txt | sort | uniq > unique_names.txt`
3. `ps aux | grep python | wc -l`
4. `history | grep git | tail -5`

**Predict the output, then test if you can!**

---

## Process Management Commands

| Command | Purpose                  | Example        |
| ------- | ------------------------ | -------------- |
| `ps`    | List processes           | `ps aux`       |
| `top`   | Interactive process view | `top`          |
| `kill`  | Terminate process        | `kill -9 1234` |
| `jobs`  | List background jobs     | `jobs`         |
| `bg`    | Resume job in background | `bg %1`        |
| `fg`    | Bring job to foreground  | `fg %1`        |

---

## Background Execution

```shell
# Run in background
command &

# Suspend current process
Ctrl+Z

# Run immune to hangups
nohup command &
```

### System Information
```shell
uname -a        # System information
df -h           # Disk usage
du -sh *        # Directory sizes
free -h         # Memory usage
uptime          # System uptime and load
```

---

## File Permissions

```
-rwxr-xr-- 1 user group 1024 Jan 1 12:00 file.txt
â”‚â”‚â”‚â”‚â”‚â”‚â”‚â”‚â”‚
â”‚â”‚â”‚â”‚â”‚â”‚â”‚â””â”€ Other: Read only (4)
â”‚â”‚â”‚â”‚â”‚â”‚â””â”€â”€ Group: Execute (1)
â”‚â”‚â”‚â”‚â”‚â””â”€â”€â”€ Group: No write (0)
â”‚â”‚â”‚â”‚â””â”€â”€â”€â”€ Group: Read (4)
â”‚â”‚â”‚â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ Owner/user: Execute (1)
â”‚â”‚â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ Owner/user: Write (2)
â”‚â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ Owner/user: Read (4)
â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ File type (- = regular file)
```

---

## Permission Commands

<div class='cols'><div>

```shell
# Set permissions using octal notation
chmod 755 script.sh             # rwxr-xr-x

# Add execute permission for user
chmod u+x file.sh

# Recursive permission change
chmod -R 644 documents/

# Change ownership
chown user:group file.txt
```

</div><div>

### Octal Notation
- Read (r) = 4
- Write (w) = 2
- Execute (x) = 1

</div></div>

---

## Shell Scripting Basics

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This is a comment

echo "Hello, World!"
NAME="Student"
echo "Welcome, $NAME"

# Conditionals
if [ -f "file.txt" ]; then
    echo "File exists"
fi

# Loops
for i in {1..5}; do
    echo "Number: $i"
done
```

---

## Making Scripts Executable

```shell
# Make script executable
chmod +x script.sh

# Run the script
./script.sh
```

### Command Line Arguments
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Script name: $0"
echo "First argument: $1"
echo "All arguments: $@"
echo "Number of arguments: $#"
```

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Active Learning: Script Writing

**Create a script that:**
1. Takes a filename as an argument
2. Checks if the file exists
3. If it exists, count the number of lines
4. If it doesn't, create an empty file

---

## Safety Tips

1. Use `rm -i` for interactive deletion
2. Test with `echo` before running destructive commands
3. Use `--dry-run` when available
4. Keep backups before bulk operations

### Example: Testing Before Deletion
```shell
# First, see what would be deleted
echo rm *.log

# Then execute if it looks right
rm *.log
```

---

## Efficiency Tips

### Shortcuts
```shell
# Tab completion: Press Tab to auto-complete
# History search: Ctrl+R for reverse search
```

### Aliases
```shell
alias ll='ls -la'
alias ..='cd ..'
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Ctrl+A**: Beginning of line
- **Ctrl+E**: End of line
- **Ctrl+K**: Delete to end of line
- **Ctrl+U**: Delete to beginning of line

---

## Getting Help: RTFM

```shell
man command        # Manual pages
command --help     # Built-in help
which command      # Find command location
type command       # Show command type
apropos keyword    # Search manual pages
```

**Remember**: `man` is your friend!

---
