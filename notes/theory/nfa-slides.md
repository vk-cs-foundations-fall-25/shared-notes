# Nondeterministic Finite Automata (NFA)

## A useful generalization of a DFA

---

# Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

- **Define** what an NFA is and how it differs from a DFA
- **Identify** nondeterministic transitions in automata
- **Convert** between NFAs and DFAs
- **Implement** NFAs in code
- **Recognize** regular languages

---

# What is an NFA?

**Nondeterministic Finite Automata (NFA)**
- A useful generalization of a DFA
- Allows more flexible state transitions
- Makes some automata simpler to design

**Key Question:** Does this added flexibility make NFAs more powerful than DFAs?

---

# NFA Enhancement #1
## Multiple Transitions on Same Symbol

A state can have transitions to **multiple states** on the same symbol

<div class='cols'><div>

![alt text](../media/multi-transitions.excalidraw.svg)

</div><div>

When reading '1' from state q1:
- Can go to q2 OR
- Can go to q3

</div></div>

---

# NFA Enhancement #2
## Null Transitions (Îµ-transitions)

A state can transition without reading any symbol

<div class='cols'><div>

![alt text](../media/null-transitions.excalidraw.svg)

</div><div>

From q1, can spontaneously move to q2 or q3 without consuming input

</div></div>

---

# NFA Enhancement #3
## Missing Transitions

A state can have **no transitions** for some symbols (dead ends)

<div class='cols'><div>

![alt text](../media/no-transitions.excalidraw.svg)

</div><div>

No transition defined for '1' from q1
- If '1' is read, this path dies

</div></div>

---

# How to Run an NFA?

**The Nondeterministic Approach:**

1. **Follow all possible paths** simultaneously
2. If **any path** leads to an accept state â†’ **ACCEPT**
3. If **all paths** fail â†’ **REJECT**

Think of it as:
- Exploring multiple parallel universes
- Success in any universe = overall success

---

# ðŸŽ¯ Quick Check #1

Given this NFA fragment, what happens when we read '1' from q1?

# Example 1: Strings Ending in "1"

**Language:** Binary strings ending in "1"

# Example 3: Third Position from End

![width:900px](../media/nfa.excalidraw.svg)

**Question:** Where's the nondeterminism?

---

# Example 3: Analysis

![width:700px](../media/nfa.excalidraw.svg)

**Nondeterminism:** q1 has multiple transitions on '1'
- q1 â†’ q1 (stay)
- q1 â†’ q2 (guess this is 3rd from end)

**Language:** Binary strings with '1' in 3rd position from end

---

# ðŸŽ¯ Active Learning: Trace Example

Trace the string "10110" through Example 3 NFA

Work with a partner to:
1. List all possible paths
2. Identify which paths accept
3. Determine if string is accepted

---

# Example 4: "OR" with null-transitions

![width:500px](../media/nfa-2.excalidraw.svg)

**Where's the nondeterminism?**

---

# Example 4: Analysis

![width:400px](../media/nfa-2.excalidraw.svg)

**Nondeterminism:** q1 has Îµ-transitions to two branches

**Language:** Strings with even number of 0s OR odd number of 1s

---

# The Big Question

## Does nondeterminism make NFAs more powerful than DFAs?

ðŸ¤” Think about it...

Can NFAs recognize languages that DFAs cannot?

---

# The Surprising Answer

## **NO!**

> **An NFA is equivalent to a DFA**

Every NFA can be converted to an equivalent DFA!

But how? ðŸ¤¯

---

# NFA to DFA Conversion: The Idea

**Subset Construction:**

- If NFA has N states
  - There are 2^N possible subsets of states
- Each subset becomes a DFA state

**Example:** NFA with 3 states {q1, q2, q3}
- DFA states: {}, {q1}, {q2}, {q3}, {q1,q2}, {q1,q3}, {q2,q3}, {q1,q2,q3}

---

# Conversion Example: Building the Table

![width:600px](../media/nfa.excalidraw.svg)

Let's convert this NFA to a DFA...

---

# DFA State Transition Table

| DFA State   | 0           | 1              |
| ----------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| **{q1}**    | {q1}        | **{q1,q2}**    |
| **{q1,q2}** | **{q1,q3}** | **{q1,q2,q3}** |
| **{q1,q3}** | **{q1,q4}** | **{q1,q2,q4}** |
| **{q1,q4}** | {q1}        | {q1,q2}        |

(Partial table shown - 8 more rows needed for complete DFA)

---

# The Resulting DFA

![width:900px](../media/nfa-to-dfa.excalidraw.svg)

**Which looks simpler to you?** ðŸ¤”

---

# ðŸŽ¯ Active Learning: Conversion Practice

Given this simple NFA:

![alt text](../media/one-or-more-nfa.excalidraw.svg)

1. Identify all subset states needed
2. Build first 3 rows of transition table
3. Which subsets are accept states?

---

# Implementing NFAs in Java

## Key API Difference from DFA

```java
public class NFA {
  public static class State {
    void addTransition(Character symbol, State to) {...}
    
    // Returns SET of states, not single state!
    Set<State> getTransition(Character symbol) {...}
  }
  
  public boolean accepts(String input) {...}
}
```

---

# Implementation Strategy

**Processing the i-th symbol:**

1. **Before reading:** Check Îµ-reachable states
   - Follow all null transitions
   - Beware of cycles!

2. **After reading:** Follow all symbol transitions
   - Explore all possible next states

**Recommendation:** Use recursion!

---

# Supporting Null Transitions

**Practical approach:**

```java
// Use special character for epsilon
char EPSILON = '\0';

// Add epsilon transitions
state1.addTransition(EPSILON, state2);

// Check epsilon transitions
Set<State> epsilonStates = 
    currentState.getTransition(EPSILON);
```

---

# Regular Languages

## Definition

> A formal language is called a **regular language** if some DFA **or NFA** recognizes it.

**Key insight:** Since DFA â‰¡ NFA
- Language regular if DFA recognizes it
- Language regular if NFA recognizes it
- Same expressive power!

---

# Why Use NFAs Then?

If NFAs = DFAs in power, why bother?

## Advantages of NFAs:
- **Simpler** to design
- **Fewer states** needed
- **More intuitive** for certain patterns
- **Easier** to combine (union, concatenation)

## Trade-off:
- Harder to implement/simulate

---

# ðŸŽ¯ Design Challenge

**Your Turn:** Design an NFA for:

"Binary strings containing the substring '101'"

1. Sketch your NFA 
2. Compare with a partner
3. How many states did you use?

Would the DFA be simpler or more complex?

---

# Key Takeaways

1. NFAs add two types of nondeterminism:
   1. Multiple transitions per symbol
   2. Epsilon transitions
2. NFAs are equivalent to DFAs in power
3. NFAs often simpler to design but harder to simulate
4. Regular languages = Languages recognized by DFA or NFA
