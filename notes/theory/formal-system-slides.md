# The Big Question

## What exactly is a computational problem?

**Answer:** A **formal system** or **formal language**

*Let's build up to this answer step by step...*

---

# Building Blocks: Alphabets

## Definition
> An **alphabet** (denoted Œ£) is a finite set of symbols

### Examples:

| Name | Alphabet Œ£ | Usage |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Binary | \{0, 1\} | Computer memory |
| Decimal | \{0, 1, 2, ..., 9\} | Human numbers |
| DNA | \{A, C, G, T\} | Genetic sequences |
| English lowercase | \{a, b, c, ..., z\} | Text processing |

---

# üéØ Quick Check #1

## Which of these are valid alphabets?

1. \{0, 1, 2, ...\}
2. \{‚ô†, ‚ô£, ‚ô•, ‚ô¶\}
3. \{$\text{red}, \text{green}, \text{blue}$\}
4. All real numbers between 0 and 1
5. \{+, -, *, /\}

**Think:** What's the key requirement for an alphabet?

---

# Quick Check #1 - Answers

## Valid Alphabets ‚úì

2. \{‚ô†, ‚ô£, ‚ô•, ‚ô¶\} - Finite set of symbols ‚úì
3. \{$\text{red}, \text{green}, \text{blue}$\} - Finite set ‚úì
5. \{+, -, *, /\} - Finite set of operators ‚úì

## Invalid Alphabets ‚úó

1. \{0, 1, 2, ...\} - **Infinite** set ‚úó
4. All real numbers - **Infinite** and uncountable ‚úó

**Key:** Alphabets must be **finite**!

---

# Building Blocks: Strings

## Definition
> A **string** (or word) is a finite sequence of symbols from an alphabet

### Notation:
- Empty string: Œµ (epsilon) or Œª (lambda)
- String length: |w| where w is a string
- Concatenation: xy (string x followed by string y)

---

# String Examples

## Over different alphabets:

| Alphabet | Example Strings | Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|
| \{0, 1\} | `1011`, `00`, `Œµ` | Binary strings |
| \{a, ..., z\} | `hello`, `xyz`, `aaa` | English-like |
| \{0, ..., 9\} | `42`, `007`, `999` | Numeric strings |

### Things to note:
- Strings are **finite** 
- Order matters: `abc` ‚â† `bca`
- Repetition allowed: `aaa` is valid

# üìù Active Learning: String Construction

**Your Turn:** Given alphabet Œ£ = \{a, b\}

1. Write all strings of length 0
2. Write all strings of length 1
3. Write all strings of length 2
4. How many strings of length n exist?

---

# String Construction - Solution

## For alphabet Œ£ = \(\{a, b\}\):

| Length | Strings | Count |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 0 | `Œµ` | 1 |
| 1 | `a`, `b` | 2 |
| 2 | `aa`, `ab`, `ba`, `bb` | 4 |
| 3 | `aaa`, `aab`, `aba`, ...| 8 |
| n | All combinations | \(2^n\) |

**Pattern:** For alphabet of size k, there are \(k^n\) strings of length n

---

# The Main Concept: Formal Languages

## Definition
> A **formal language** L is a set of strings over an alphabet

### Key Points:
- Can be finite or **infinite**
- Subset of all possible strings (L ‚äÜ Œ£*)
- Œ£* denotes all possible strings over alphabet Œ£

### Examples:
- L‚ÇÅ = \(\{00, 11\}\) - finite language
- L‚ÇÇ = \(\{a^n b^n | n ‚â• 0\}\) = \(\{Œµ, ab, aabb, aaabbb, ...\}\) - infinite

---

# Formal Language Examples

| Language Description | In Language ‚úì | Not in Language ‚úó |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **English** | `apple`, `racecar`, `computer` | `qptey`, `znwy` |
| **Palindromes** | `bob`, `racecar`, `noon` | `apple`, `banana` |
| **Prime numbers** | `2`, `3`, `5`, `7`, `11` | `1`, `4`, `6`, `8` |
| **Valid emails** | `user@domain.com` | `user@`, `@domain` |
| **Balanced parentheses** | `()`, `(())`, `(()())` | `(`, `())`, `(()` |

---

## More Complex Patterns

### 1. Even Binary Numbers
L = $\{w ‚àà \{0,1\}^* | w \text{ ends with } 0\}$
- In: `10`, `100`, `1110`
- Not in: `11`, `101`, `1`

### 2. Equal Count Language
L = \{a^n b^n | n ‚â• 0\}
- In: `Œµ`, `ab`, `aabb`, `aaabbb`
- Not in: `aab`, `abab`, `ba`

# ü§î Active Learning: Language Detective

**Challenge:** Determine the pattern!

Language L contains: `a`, `aa`, `aaaa`, `aaaaaaaa`
Language L does NOT contain: `Œµ`, `aaa`, `aaaaa`, `aaaaaa`

**Questions:**
1. What's the pattern?
2. Write L in set notation
3. Is `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa` in L?

*(5 minutes - discuss with partner)*

---

# Language Detective - Solution

## The Pattern Revealed

**Observation:** String lengths are 1, 2, 4, 8...

### Answer:
L = $\{a^{2^n} | n ‚â• 0\} = \{a^1, a^2, a^4, a^8, a^{16}, ...\}$

Strings with length equal to powers of 2!

**Is `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa` (16 a's) in L?**
Yes! 16 = 2‚Å¥, so a¬π‚Å∂ ‚àà L

# Programming Languages as Formal Languages

## Connecting Theory to Practice

| Formal Language | Valid Strings | Invalid Strings |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Java Identifiers** | `x`, `myVar`, `_test` | `123abc`, `my-var`, `class` |
| **Java Programs** | Complete compilable code | Syntax errors |
| **SQL Queries** | `SELECT * FROM users` | `SELECTING FROM users` |

### Key Insight:
**Compilers** are language recognizers - they check if your code belongs to the formal language of valid programs!

---

# Special Mathematical Example

## Fermat's Last Theorem as a Language

**Language Definition:**
L = $\{n ‚àà ‚Ñ§ | x^n + y^n = z^n \text{ for some integers } x, y, z > 0 \text{ and } n > 2\}$

### Amazing Fact:
- **L = ‚àÖ** (empty set)
- Proved by Andrew Wiles in 1995
- Took 350+ years to prove!

This shows how formal languages can encode deep mathematical problems

---

# Why Formal Languages Matter

## 1. **Precise Problem Definition**

Instead of asking vaguely "Is x prime?", we ask:
> "Is string x in the language PRIMES = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...}?"

## 2. **Computability Analysis**

We can formally prove:
- What problems are solvable
- What problems are unsolvable
- Complexity of solutions

---

# Graph Problems as Languages

## Encoding Complex Objects

**Problem:** Is graph G connected?

**Formal Language Approach:**
1. Encode graph as string: `<G>` = `"[n1,n2,n3],[(n1,n2),(n2,n3)]"`
2. Define: CONNECTED = $\{<G> | G \text{ is a connected graph}\}$
3. Question becomes: Is `<G>` ‚àà CONNECTED?

This transformation enables mathematical analysis!

# The Power of Formalization

## From Informal to Formal

| Informal Question | Formal Language |
|:---|:---|
| "Is this password strong?" | L = {passwords with 8+ chars, number, special} |
| "Is this chemical formula valid?" | L = {valid molecular formulas} |
| "Can I win this game?" | L = {game states with winning strategy} |

**Key Benefit:** Mathematical tools can now be applied!
